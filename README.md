Tiger Agent is a production-ready library for building AI-powered Slack bots that can handle thousands of concurrent conversations with enterprise-grade reliability and
(optionally) zero-code setup via CLI.

## Features

- **üîí Durable & Atomic Event Handling**: PostgreSQL-backed event claiming ensures exactly-once processing with no duplicates, even under high concurrency and failure conditions
- **‚ö° Bounded Concurrency**: Fixed worker pools prevent resource exhaustion while maintaining predictable performance under load
- **üéØ Immediate Event Processing**: Events are processed within milliseconds of arrival rather than waiting for polling cycles, providing real-time responsiveness
- **üîÑ Resilient Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with visibility thresholds and cleanup of stuck or expired events
- **üìà Horizontal Scalability**: Multiple instances can run simultaneously with coordinated work distribution across all instances
- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Responses**: Pydantic-AI Agents using the model of your choice with (optional) MCP server integrations
- **üîß Extensible Architecture**: No coding required for basic bots and easy customization via Python for more specialized use cases
- **üîç Complete Observability**: Full Logfire instrumentation provides detailed tracing of event flow, worker activity, and database operations

## What is TigerData building with Tiger Agent?

At TigerData, we have used Tiger Agent to build Eon.
Eon is an agentic bot living in our internal Slack workspace.
Eon answers all sorts of questions for us.

We are building Eon in the open. Check out our work at [https://github.com/timescale/tiger-eon](https://github.com/timescale/tiger-eon).
Use what we have learned as a reference for building your own Tiger Agent. Share with us what you learn!

We have found Eon to be an extremely valuable addition to our company.

### What makes Eon special?

We gave Eon superpowers via multiple MCP servers, including:

1. **Slack** - Eon can read the conversation for context more like a human would. They can also search Slack for answers.
   [https://github.com/timescale/tiger-slack](https://github.com/timescale/tiger-slack)
2. **Docs** - Eon can search TigerData docs, Postgres docs, and use our curated prompts.
   [https://github.com/timescale/tiger-docs-mcp-server](https://github.com/timescale/tiger-docs-mcp-server)
3. **Memory** - Eon can "remember" important facts about interactions. [https://github.com/timescale/tiger-memory-mcp-server](https://github.com/timescale/tiger-memory-mcp-server)
4. **Linear** - Eon can read our Linear issues. [https://github.com/timescale/tiger-linear-mcp-server](https://github.com/timescale/tiger-linear-mcp-server)
5. **GitHub** - Eon can read our commits and pull requests. [https://github.com/timescale/tiger-gh-mcp-server](https://github.com/timescale/tiger-gh-mcp-server)
6. **Salesforce** - Eon can read our support cases. [https://github.com/timescale/tiger-salesforce-mcp-server](https://github.com/timescale/tiger-salesforce-mcp-server)

None of these MCP servers are **required** to use Tiger Agent, but feel free to if they suit your needs.

## Quick Start

### 0. Prerequisites

1. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
2. [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
3. An ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

### 1. Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/timescale/tiger-agent
cd tiger-agent

# install the dependencies
uv sync

# verify the installation
uv run tiger_agent --help
```

### 2. Run a TimescaleDB database in a docker container.

```bash
# pull the latest image
docker pull timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg17

# run the database container
docker run -d --name tiger-agent \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=tsdb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=tsdbadmin \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
  timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg17
```

### 3. Create a Slack App

Tiger Agent use the Slack Events API with Socket Mode to receive `app_mention` events when your Slack users mention the bot.
You must create a Slack App for your Tiger Agent.

1. Edit the [slack-manifest.json](/slack-manifest.json) file to have the names and descriptions you want to use.
2. [Create a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)
3. Choose to create an app **from a manifest**.
4. Pick your workspace and click `Next`.
5. Paste that manifest configuration in the input field provided and click `Next`.
6. Review and verify that the configuration you entered matches the summary and click `Create`.
7. Navigate to: Basic Information ‚Üí App-Level Tokens
8. Click 'Generate Token and Scopes' ‚Üí Add 'connections:write' scope ‚Üí Generate
9. Save your `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (It starts with `xapp-`).
10. Navigate to: Install App ‚Üí Click 'Install to [Workspace]'
11. After installation, save the 'Bot User OAuth Token' A.K.A. `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (It starts with `xapp-`)

### 4. Set your environment variables

Copy the sample .env file.

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```
Edit the .env file.

1. Add your `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`. It starts with `xapp-`.
2. Add your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`. It starts with `xoxb-`.
3. Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. It starts with `sk-ant-`.
4. [OPTIONAL] Add your `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`. It starts with `pylf_`.

### 5. Run the Tiger Agent

Run the Tiger Agent.

```bash
uv run tiger_agent run 
```

At this point, Tiger Agent will be receiving `app_mention` events from your Slack workspace.
Send a Slack message mentioning your bot by name.

## Customization

For light customization, you can use [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) templates to customize the system and user prompts.
You can give your Tiger Agent custom superpowers by configuring one or more MCP servers. See the [CLI docs](/docs/cli.md) for more information.

For heavy customization, you can subclass the TigerAgent class or implement an EventProcessor from scratch. 
Check out the [Tiger Agent docs](/docs/tiger_agent.md) to see how.
